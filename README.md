# Note Taker Starter Code

Welcome to my Note Taker App. Click on Get Started to begin Writing Notes. You can begin writing notes when you click on the place holder text. Once you've written a note and given it a title, a save icon appears and you can save your note. You can save as many notes as you want. There is a trash can icon next to each note, which allows you to delete a note. If you click on a note, you can load it and edit the note if you want. Or if you want to rewrite the note, the pencil icon at the top right corner of the screen will reset the note. All notes save in a JSON file.
